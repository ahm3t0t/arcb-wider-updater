## 🔐 Release Signature Verification (v4.1.0+)

From **v4.1.0 onwards**, all releases are **cryptographically signed with GPG**.

### Why Sign Releases?
- ✅ Proves releases come from official maintainer
- ✅ Detects tampering or man-in-the-middle attacks
- ✅ Ensures file integrity (SHA256SUMS)
- ✅ Industry standard security practice

### Quick Verification

#### Step 1: Import Public Key
```bash
# Import GPG key from repository
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahm3t0t/arcb-wider-updater/main/pubkey.asc | gpg --import

# Verify key fingerprint
gpg --list-keys ahmet@tanrikulu.net
# Expected: A9B7 CABC 5BC1 9608 7895 8003 E5B7 57C6 9EFF 27BF
```

#### Step 2: Download Release Files
```bash
# Download checksums and signature
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ahm3t0t/arcb-wider-updater/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS -o SHA256SUMS
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ahm3t0t/arcb-wider-updater/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS.asc -o SHA256SUMS.asc
```

#### Step 3: Verify Signature
```bash
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
# Look for: "Good signature from Ahmet T. (arcb-wider-updater signing key)"
```

#### Step 4: Verify File Hash
```bash
# Download the script
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ahm3t0t/arcb-wider-updater/releases/latest/download/guncel -o guncel

# Verify hash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
# Expected: guncel: OK
```

### Signing Key Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Key ID** | `E5B757C69EFF27BF` |
| **Fingerprint** | `A9B7 CABC 5BC1 9608 7895 8003 E5B7 57C6 9EFF 27BF` |
| **UID** | `Ahmet T. (arcb-wider-updater signing key) <ahmet@tanrikulu.net>` |
| **Created** | 2026-01-28 |
| **Algorithm** | RSA 4096 |

### Automated Verification

The `install.sh` script performs GPG verification automatically during installation. If GPG is not installed, verification is skipped with a warning.

```bash
# Full verified installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahm3t0t/arcb-wider-updater/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```
