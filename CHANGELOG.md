## [3.8.1] - 2026-01-26
### Added
- **Test Automation:** New GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/test.yml`
  - ShellCheck lint for `guncel` and `install.sh`
  - Bash syntax validation (`bash -n`)

### Fixed
- **fwupd Exit Code Handling:** `fwupdmgr get-updates` returns exit code 2 for "No updatable devices"
  - This is now treated as success (not an error)
  - Prevents false error messages on systems without updatable firmware
  - Both dry-run and actual update modes handle this correctly

### Changed
- VERSION: 3.8.0 → 3.8.1

  - Version management: SemVer explanation, dual version system
  - Test scenarios: shellcheck, bash -n, --dry-run, --help
  - PR process: branch naming, review checklist

## [Night-V1.0.0] - 2026-01-26 (install.sh)
### Changed
- **install.sh artık ayrı versiyon sistemi kullanıyor**
  - Format: Night-Vx.x.x

## [3.8.0] - 2026-01-26
### Added
- **GitHub Actions Release Automation:** Automatic release creation on tag push
  - New workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Trigger: `push tags v*`
  - Automatically generates `SHA256SUMS` for `guncel` and `install.sh`
  - Creates GitHub Release with checksums attached
- **--dry-run mode:** Preview updates without applying them
  - Shows available updates for APT, DNF, Flatpak, Snap, and Firmware
  - Uses native list commands: `apt list --upgradable`, `flatpak remote-ls --updates`, etc.
  - No changes made to system - safe for testing

### Changed
- VERSION: 3.7.2 → 3.8.0
- CODENAME: "Rotated" → "Automated"
- Updated --help with --dry-run option and examples
- Self-update skipped in dry-run mode

### Notes
- Release automation requires no additional setup - uses built-in GITHUB_TOKEN
- To create a release: `git tag v3.8.0 && git push origin v3.8.0`

## [3.7.2] - 2026-01-26
### Fixed
- **Hotfix:** Fixed Flatpak counter newline bug causing syntax error on Zorin OS 18
  - `wc -l` output sometimes contains newline characters that break arithmetic expressions
  - Added `tr -cd '0-9'` sanitization to all counter variables (flatpak, snap, fwupd)
  - Fixes: `[[: 0\n0: syntax error in expression` on line 666

## [3.7.1] - 2026-01-25
### Fixed
- Fixed install.sh color codes and first character display issue
- Changed echo -e to printf with ANSI-C quoting for reliable output

## [v3.7.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Logrotate support:** Automatic log rotation and cleanup
  - New config file: `/etc/logrotate.d/arcb-wider-updater`
  - Weekly rotation, keeps 4 weeks of logs
  - Compresses old logs automatically
  - Installed automatically via install.sh
- **Log management documentation:** Added to README (TR/EN)

### Changed
- VERSION: 3.6.1 → 3.7.0
- CODENAME: "Configurable" → "Rotated"
- Manual log cleanup in guncel disabled (logrotate handles it now)
- install.sh updated to install logrotate config

### Removed
- Manual 30-day log deletion (replaced by logrotate)

## [v3.6.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **--skip/--only flags:** Selective backend execution
  - `--skip snapshot,flatpak,snap,fwupd,dnf` to skip specific backends
  - `--only system,flatpak,fwupd` to run only specified backends
  - Example: `guncel --skip flatpak,snap` or `guncel --only dnf`
- **Config file support:** `/etc/arcb-wider-updater.conf`
  - Define default modes, skip settings, and colors
  - Command line arguments override config settings
- **SHA256 verification during self-update:**
  - Downloads `SHA256SUMS` from GitHub Releases
  - Cancels update if hash doesn't match
  - Provides security against tampered downloads
- **.bak backup mechanism:**
  - Creates `/usr/local/bin/guncel.bak` before self-update
  - Enables easy rollback: `sudo cp /usr/local/bin/guncel.bak /usr/local/bin/guncel`
  - install.sh also creates .bak backup

### Changed
- VERSION: 3.5.0 → 3.6.0
- CODENAME: "Locked & Loaded" → "Configurable"
- Argument parsing now uses while loop with shift for proper --skip/--only handling
- Updated --help output with new options and examples

### Security
- SHA256 hash verification prevents installation of tampered scripts
- Automatic rollback on failed updates

## [v3.5.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Concurrent execution lock using `flock` (prevents cron + manual conflicts)
- DNF lock retry mechanism with `wait_for_dnf_lock()` function
  - Uses `pgrep` to check for running dnf/yum/rpm processes
  - Max 30 attempts with 10 second intervals
  - Gracefully skips DNF update if lock cannot be acquired

### Changed
- CODENAME: "Colorful" → "Locked & Loaded"

### Notes
- `flock` is typically included with `util-linux` package (pre-installed on most systems)

## [v3.4.6] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- Fixed missing first character in header display (echo -e issue)
- Fixed ANSI color codes that were broken (escape sequences restored)
