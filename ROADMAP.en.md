## 💡 Ideas Under Consideration

| Idea | Status | Note |
|------|--------|------|
| Desktop notifications | 🤔 Uncertain | Evaluating for v6.x |
| Parallel updates | ❌ Deferred | Risky, complex |
| Rust migration | ❌ Deferred | Bash is sufficient |
| Web UI | ❌ Out of scope | Staying CLI-focused |
| Plugin system | ❌ Deferred | Complexity |
| DEB/RPM packaging | ❌ Deferred | curl-pipe-bash is sufficient |
